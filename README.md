# Game-Engine
Alpha Version 22.12

# What's my motivation?
I don't like Unity because it is way too large and has many unnecessary features
Unreal Engine is just abig NO for me, since it has no Linux version, so I have ~2 options left.
I like Godot, because it's light-weight and easy-to-use, but I don't like GDScript because I want it to use either C++ or Lua.
And that's why I'm writing my own Engine.

# Features
The scripting language will be Lua (and C++)
It will use OpenGL 3.3 Core (or higher)
I really want to add soft-body support and a good physics engine
It will have built-in networking (using SDL2_net)
The targeted platforms will be: Windows and Linux (it wont have apple build support, but maybe later Android)
