# Game-Engine
Alpha Version (22.12)

# What's my motivation?
I don't like Unity because it is way too large and has many unnecessary features

Unreal Engine is just a big NO for me, since it has no Linux version, so I have ~2 options left.

I like Godot because it's light-weight, and maybe I will use it later... but I don't really like GDScript

And that's why I'm writing my own Engine.

# Features
The scripting language will be Lua (and C++)

OpenGL Version: 3.3 Core (or higher), Windowing library: GLFW

Targeted platforms: Windows and Linux (later Android)

Other Features: Physics, Virtual Cameras

# Coming Up
Audio System

Particle System

Networking

Lighting & Shadowing System


Android Build Support

# How to Build
I only have a build script for linux, but it's nothing complicated

It requires a folder named "./build" with the required include files, libraries and binaries (Coming Soon!).
