# Game-Engine
Pre-Alpha Version

This Game-Engine will be a more code-oriented Engine than others, like [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) or [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

I'm planning on optimizing it for mainly indie games; it will have medium-graphics and somewhat fast performance

It will...
- use OpenGL (3.0 ES)
- use [GLSL Shaders](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Shaders), and will have something like [Unity's Shader-Graph](https://unity.com/features/shader-graph)
- be scriptable in C++ and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html)
- be cross-platform ([Windows](https://www.mingw-w64.org/), [Linux](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [HTML](https://emscripten.org/) and Android)
- have a custom Physics Engine (or maybe [Bullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) or [React](https://www.reactphysics3d.com/))
