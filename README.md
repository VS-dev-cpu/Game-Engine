# Game-Engine
## Pre-Alpha Version

This Game-Engine will be a more code-oriented Engine than others, like [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) or [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

I'm planning on optimizing it for mainly indie games; it will have medium-graphics and somewhat fast performance

It will...
- use OpenGL (3.0 ES)
- use [GLSL Shaders](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Shaders), and will have something like [Unity's Shader-Graph](https://unity.com/features/shader-graph)
- be scriptable in C++ and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html)
- be cross-platform ([Windows](https://www.mingw-w64.org/), [Linux](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [HTML](https://emscripten.org/) and Android)
- have a custom Physics Engine (or maybe [Bullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) or [React](https://www.reactphysics3d.com/))

Tho these are just my plans for it, but it may (and probably will) change, but i'm making devlogs on youtube about this Engine,
and I'm looking forward for launch!

If you want to support me by anything, you can subscribe on my channel or just leave a comment somewhere (that would make me really happy), and
you can also consider being my patreon, but i'm fine with a like/comment too!

Thank you for reading it this far, i hope you'll have a good day!!! See y'all in the next devlog!

Bye :)
