# Game-Engine
Pre-Alpha Version

This Game-Engine will be a more code-oriented Engine, it will be Open-Source and free.

It is still under development, but I have a few infos that will probably not change:

It will...
- use OpenGL
- be scriptable in C++ and Lua
- be cross-platform (Windows, Linux, HTML and Android)
- have a custom physics engine (or maybe [Bullet](https://www.pybullet.org/worldpress) or [React](https://www.reactphysics3d.com/))

> WARNING: The Current Version may be outdated (by a version)

# What's my motivation?
I don't like Unity because it is way too large and has much bload,
Unreal Engine is just a big NO for me, since it has no Linux version, 
I like Godot because it's light-weight, but I don't really like GDScript

And that's why I'm writing my own Engine.

# Features
- Basic Lighting
- Text Rendering
- Physics (custom)

> NOTE: some features are not written here ('cause they are basic and/or i forgot them :) )
