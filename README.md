# Game-Engine
Pre-Alpha Version

# What's my motivation?
I don't like Unity because it is way too large and has many unnecessary features

Unreal Engine is just a big NO for me, since it has no Linux version, so I have ~2 options left.

I like Godot because it's light-weight, and maybe I will use it later... but I don't really like GDScript

And that's why I'm writing my own Engine.

# Features
Scripting language(s): Lua (and C++)

OpenGL Version: 3.3 Core/ 2.0 ES

Targeted platforms: Windows, Linux and Browser (later Android)

# How to Build
