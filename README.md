# Game-Engine
Pre-Alpha Version

This Game-Engine will be a more code-oriented Engine than others, like [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) or [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

I'm planning on optimizing it for mainly indie games; it will have medium-graphics and somewhat fast performance

It will...
- use OpenGL
- be scriptable in C++ and Lua
- be cross-platform (Windows, Linux, HTML and Android)
- have a custom physics engine (or maybe [Bullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) or [React](https://www.reactphysics3d.com/))

> WARNING: The Current Version may be outdated (by a version)

# Features
- Basic Lighting
- Text Rendering
- Physics (custom)

> NOTE: some features may not be here
