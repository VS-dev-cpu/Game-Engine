# Game-Engine
## Pre-Alpha Version

> WARNING: The Current Version may be outdated!

This Game-Engine will be a more code-oriented Engine than others, like [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) or [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

I'm planning on optimizing it for mainly indie games; it will have medium-graphics and somewhat fast performance

It will...
- use OpenGL (3.0 ES)
- use [GLSL Shaders](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Shaders), and will have something like [Unity's Shader-Graph](https://unity.com/features/shader-graph)
- be scriptable in C++ and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html)
- be cross-platform ([Windows](https://www.mingw-w64.org/), [Linux](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [HTML](https://emscripten.org/) and Android)
- have a custom Physics Engine (or maybe [Bullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) or [React](https://www.reactphysics3d.com/))

... these are just my plans for it, but it may (and probably will) change, but i'm making devlogs on youtube about this Engine,
where I tell every new thing about it.

If you want to support me, you can subscribe on my channel, and you can also consider being my patreon, but i'm also fine with a like/comment too!

btw here is [My Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR8z9TUZnUDvs0XR0DUEnmw)

Thank you for reading it this far, see y'all in the next devlog!
